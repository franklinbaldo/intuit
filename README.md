# Intuit - Base64 URL to HTML Renderer

## Overview

Intuit is a minimalist web tool that decodes and renders Base64 URL encoded HTML. Created with an Apple-inspired design aesthetic, the tool provides a sleek interface for decoding Base64 URL strings to HTML, which is then rendered in real-time.

## Features

- Decode Base64 URL encoded HTML from URL parameters.
- Real-time rendering of decoded HTML within an iframe.
- Clean and user-friendly interface for ease of use.

## Use Cases

### Web Development

- Simplify the process of embedding encoded HTML into web applications.
- Quickly prototype HTML layouts by encoding them into Base64 and rendering them with Intuit.

### Data Transmission

- Enable the secure transfer of HTML content over the network by first encoding it in Base64.
  
### Debugging and Testing

- Test HTML code snippets easily by encoding them into Base64 and observing the output in real-time.
- Debug encoded HTML content that's not rendering as expected.
